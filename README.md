# Javascript30Challenge
30 day challenge - every day new application

What I learned from the 30 day challenge.

Day 1 - Javascript Drum Kit:
    1) How to use the <audio> tag in HTML and how to play it in JS
    2) How to cathc a 'transitionend' event and made me research the transition events
  
  
Day 2 - CSS JS Clock:
    1)  Using the CSS transform and transition properties
    2) Using the 'rotate(Xdeg)' function in JS
    
    
Day 3 - Woah! CSS Variables
    1) Here I first got a glance at the CSS Variables technology (--somevariable: value)
    2) It looks seems like a cool thing(WE HAVE VARIABLES IN CSS THAT CAN BE ACCESSED THROUGH JS), but there are some issues
        - Code can get messy fast
        - There is still a compability issue with some older browsers (77% in caniuse.com)
    3) Here are some FAQs and good practices when using CSS Variables:
        - Using :root as a selector is a good practice because we have collect all our variables in one place and thus making our code easier for maintenance
        - Use dashes or underscope for naming convention as CSS Variables are case sensitive and camel case can be hard to spot when debugging css code
        
Day 4 - JavaScript Array Cardio Practice
        1) It was a good practice to remind how the some of the Array Manipulation methods for ES6 are applied. More particularly I liked the exrcise with the sort() function and the last one with the reduce() in which I used the object to store the data.
